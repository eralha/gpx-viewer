GPX Viewer
=====================

A phonegap build project, this is an app to read and navigate GPX files.

You can donwload GPX files on a website like <a href="https://www.wikiloc.com/" target="_blank">https://www.wikiloc.com/</a>.

The app will load a GPX file stored on your phone, and draw the path on the google maps, to navigate go to settings tab and turn on, follow gps and rotate map.
Then the app will start centering the map on you GPS position, and rotating the map according to compass information.

## Building the app

We recommend using the <a href="https://build.phonegap.com/" target="_blank">phonegap build</a> service since the config is meant to be built there.

## Why this?

I build this app because i couldn't find any free app that fulfilled my adventure riding needs, i needed an app that updated my GPS position every second, and that rotate the map with compass information.
